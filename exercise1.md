For the Python language, there are several good tools for setting up the CI environment. Many languages have several linting tools. For Python there is for example Pylint, Flake8 and Bandit linting tools available. Flake8 is mainly intended to check stylings of your code. When choosing linting tools for Python project, Flake8 may not be enough for all linting. Pylint is tool which checks wide variety of errors. It cheks style guide, programmatic errors and follows best practices. So it could be good to choose both Pylint and Flake8 for linting Python project. 

On top of linting tools, its good to use some testing tools in your Python project. There is many tools available, but I will go through just a few of the most popular testing tools. PyUnit “aka” UnitTest is one of the most used tool for testing, because its involved in the standard Python library. Because of that you wont have to install additional testing tool modules to your project. Propably the most used test framework is, however PyTest. Other options for testing are Robot framework, Python Behave and Python Gauge. Because Python is interpreted language, its actually not needed to make build from your Python project.

Popular way to set up the CI environment is to use Jenkins or GitHub Actions. There is also alternative services available, for example Travis CI and Buildbot. Although Travis CI is build with Ruby, it can still be used with python. One negative aspect of this service is, that its not totally free. Unless you are  building an open source project, you will be charged a small fee. Buildbot is written in Python so its also good alternative CI service for Python projects.

Would this setup be better in a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment? In this hypothetical situation we have project which has six people working on it. Because the project is probably rather small, it should be better to set up environment to cloud. Its much faster to set up and it probably has enough resources to our project. In large projects it could be better to have self-hosted environment.
